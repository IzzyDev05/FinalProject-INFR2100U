ADDED - Graph:
This class uses a Dictionary that will hold the Key which represents the Node of the graph. Each Node has a List of other Nodes that will represent the list of adjancent Nodes (neighbouring countries).

Map:
This class just holds a Graph of every continent and a Graph of every country. This data could be later used to render the map or do other processes on all data.


Country:
This class holds a name, owner, population, and position.
The name can be used for identification, debugging, or display.
The owner can be used for game mechanics such as distributing extra armies for controlling a full continent.
The population can be used while calculating how many dice should be used during combat.
The position can be used for rendering or automatically assigning connected countries. 


Continent:
This class holds the amount of extra armies awarded per turn for complete ownership, and a list of every country that is part of the continent.
The Graph of participating countries can be used to assign unique properties to whole continents, or be used during calculations for game mechanics that involve continents. 
The function CheckIfSoleOwned returns true if the entire country is owned by one player, and returns false otherwise.
The function GetFirstOwner returns the owner of the first country in the list of countries. This can be used after checking for sole ownership to determine who should be rewarded with the extra armies.
